|---|---|
| team-brief | Daily cross-reference of GitHub, Linear, Slack, and PostHog — see what shipped, what's stuck, and where to unblock your team |
| comprehensive-analysis | Deep 7-day analysis for sprint retros, tech debt reviews, and engineering health assessments |
| meeting-transcript | Capture architecture decisions, sprint planning outcomes, and 1:1 action items with structured ownership tracking |
| daily-brief | Stay current on engineering trends, security advisories, and technology shifts relevant to your stack |
| braindump | Capture technical design thoughts, incident learnings, and team observations with automatic classification |
| weekly-checkin | Spot patterns across sprints — recurring blockers, velocity trends, team dynamics shifts |
| knowledge-consolidation | Build engineering playbooks and decision records from scattered technical notes |
| url-dump | Save technical articles, architecture references, and tool evaluations with auto-extracted insights |
| onboarding | Initial setup — run this first |
| update-cog | Keep your COG framework current |

## Recommended Integrations

| Integration | Why it matters for you |
|---|---|
| github | PRs, commits, reviews, CI/CD status — the core data source for engineering intelligence |
| linear | Sprint tracking, issue status, blockers — enables two-way sync from team-brief back to Linear |
| slack | Team discussions, incident threads, and engineering channel activity inform team-brief context |
| posthog | Feature flag status, error rates, and performance metrics — the production health layer |

## Suggested Agent Mode

`team` — Engineering leads manage enough data streams that delegated analysis produces significantly better results, especially for comprehensive-analysis and team-brief.
