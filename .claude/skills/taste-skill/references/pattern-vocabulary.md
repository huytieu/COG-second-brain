# Pattern Vocabulary

The full reference vocabulary of named design/motion patterns taste-skill should recognize and reach for. Section 12 (the Block Library, in SKILL.md) implements a subset of these with real code.

## 10. REFERENCE VOCABULARY (Pattern Names the Agent Should Know)

This is a vocabulary, not a library. The agent should KNOW these pattern names to communicate about them, design with them in mind, and reach for them when the design read calls for them. **Implementations and code sketches live in the Block Library (Section 12), which is populated iteratively.**

### Hero Paradigms
* **Asymmetric Split Hero** - Text on one side, asset on the other, generous white space.
* **Editorial Manifesto Hero** - Large type, no asset, almost-poster.
* **Video / Media Mask Hero** - Type cut out as mask over video background.
* **Kinetic-Type Hero** - Animated typography as the primary visual.
* **Curtain-Reveal Hero** - Hero parts on scroll like a curtain.
* **Scroll-Pinned Hero** - Hero stays pinned while content scrolls behind.

### Navigation & Menus
* **Mac OS Dock Magnification** - Edge nav, icons scale fluidly on hover.
* **Magnetic Button** - Pulls toward cursor.
* **Gooey Menu** - Sub-items detach like viscous liquid.
* **Dynamic Island** - Morphing pill for status / alerts.
* **Contextual Radial Menu** - Circular menu expanding at click point.
* **Floating Speed Dial** - FAB springing into curved secondary actions.
* **Mega Menu Reveal** - Full-screen dropdown, stagger-fade content.

### Layout & Grids
* **Bento Grid** - Asymmetric tile grouping (Apple Control Center).
* **Masonry Layout** - Staggered grid, no fixed row height.
* **Chroma Grid** - Borders / tiles with subtle animating gradients.
* **Split-Screen Scroll** - Two halves sliding in opposite directions.
* **Sticky-Stack Sections** - Sections that pin and stack on scroll.

### Cards & Containers
* **Parallax Tilt Card** - 3D tilt tracking mouse coordinates.
* **Spotlight Border Card** - Borders illuminate under cursor.
* **Glassmorphism Panel** - Frosted glass with inner refraction.
* **Holographic Foil Card** - Iridescent rainbow shift on hover.
* **Tinder Swipe Stack** - Physical card stack, swipe-away.
* **Morphing Modal** - Button expands into its own dialog.

### Scroll Animations
* **Sticky Scroll Stack** - Cards stick and physically stack.
* **Horizontal Scroll Hijack** - Vertical scroll → horizontal pan.
* **Locomotive / Sequence Scroll** - Video / 3D sequence tied to scrollbar.
* **Zoom Parallax** - Central background image zooming on scroll.
* **Scroll Progress Path** - SVG line drawing along scroll.
* **Liquid Swipe Transition** - Page transition like viscous liquid.

### Galleries & Media
* **Dome Gallery** - 3D panoramic gallery.
* **Coverflow Carousel** - 3D carousel with angled edges.
* **Drag-to-Pan Grid** - Boundless draggable canvas.
* **Accordion Image Slider** - Narrow strips expanding on hover.
* **Hover Image Trail** - Mouse leaves popping image trail.
* **Glitch Effect Image** - RGB-channel shift on hover.

### Typography & Text
* **Kinetic Marquee** - Endless text bands reversing on scroll.
* **Text Mask Reveal** - Massive type as transparent window to video.
* **Text Scramble Effect** - Matrix-style decoding on load / hover.
* **Circular Text Path** - Text curving along spinning circle.
* **Gradient Stroke Animation** - Outlined text with running gradient.
* **Kinetic Typography Grid** - Letters dodging the cursor.

### Micro-Interactions & Effects
* **Particle Explosion Button** - CTA shatters into particles on success.
* **Liquid Pull-to-Refresh** - Reload indicator like detaching droplets.
* **Skeleton Shimmer** - Shifting light reflection across placeholders.
* **Directional Hover-Aware Button** - Fill enters from cursor's exact side.
* **Ripple Click Effect** - Wave from click coordinates.
* **Animated SVG Line Drawing** - Vectors drawing themselves in real time.
* **Mesh Gradient Background** - Organic lava-lamp blobs.
* **Lens Blur Depth** - Background UI blurred to focus foreground action.

### Animation Library Choice
* **Motion (`motion/react`)** - default for UI / Bento / state-change motion.
* **GSAP + ScrollTrigger** - for full-page scrolltelling and scroll hijacks. Isolate in dedicated leaf components with `useEffect` cleanup.
* **Three.js / WebGL** - for canvas backgrounds and 3D scenes. Same isolation rule.
* **NEVER mix GSAP / Three.js with Motion in the same component tree.** They fight over the same frames.
