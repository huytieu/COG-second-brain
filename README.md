# COG: The Easiest Second Brain That Actually Self-Evolves

**COG = Claude + Obsidian + Git**

A self-evolving second brain system using Claude Code, Obsidian markdown files, and Git version control. No database, no vendor lock-in‚Äîjust `.md` files that think.

## What is COG?

COG is a personal productivity and knowledge management system that:

- üß† **Self-evolves**: Learns your patterns and auto-organizes content
- üîÑ **Self-heals**: Updates cross-references when you reorganize
- üìù **Plain text**: Just markdown files (no database, no vendor lock-in)
- üì± **Multi-device**: Syncs via iCloud to iPhone, iPad, Mac
- üîí **Privacy-first**: Your data, your files, your control
- üéØ **Specialized agents**: Custom AI assistants for specific workflows
- ‚úÖ **Verification-first**: No AI hallucinations, sources required

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) installed
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download) (or VSCode with Claude extension)
- Git (optional but recommended)

### Installation (3 Steps)

1. **Clone this repo into your Obsidian vault:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/obsidian-vault
   git clone https://github.com/huytieu/COG-second-brain.git
   ```

2. **Copy COG structure to your vault:**
   ```bash
   cp -r COG-second-brain/.claude .
   cp -r COG-second-brain/templates ./06-templates
   ```

3. **Open Claude Code in your vault and test:**
   ```bash
   code .
   # In Claude Code, type: /braindump
   ```

That's it! Your second brain is running.

**Weekly Evolution Cycle:**
```
Monday-Friday: Capture thoughts via /braindump
Friday: Run /consolidate-knowledge
‚Üí COG analyzes ALL your notes
‚Üí Builds frameworks you didn't explicitly create
‚Üí Updates "single source of truth" files
‚Üí Next week, it knows more about how you think
```

### 2. Self-Healing System

- Rename a file? COG updates all cross-references
- Change project structure? Auto-reclassifies content
- New project emerges? Auto-creates tracking folders
- Competitive intel mentioned? Auto-updates competitor files

### 3. Verification-First (No AI Hallucinations)

- All news must be verified with sources and dates
- 7-day freshness requirement for current events
- Explicit confidence levels for all analysis
- Multi-source cross-referencing required

### 4. Privacy-First Architecture

## Example Workflows

### Daily Intelligence Briefing

```bash
/daily-brief
```

Generates a personalized briefing with:
- Verified news from the last 7 days
- Strategic analysis relevant to your interests
- Competitive intelligence auto-extracted
- Actionable next steps

### Brain Dump ‚Üí Strategic Insights

```bash
/braindump    # Capture raw thoughts (no judgment)
/brain-dump-analysis    # Transform into insights
```

Two-stage process:
1. **Quick capture**: Preserves spontaneity, no filtering
2. **Intelligent processing**: Extracts themes, actions, connections

The system automatically:
- Classifies by domain
- Detects competitive intelligence
- Cross-references related content
- Identifies action items

### Knowledge Consolidation

```bash
/consolidate-knowledge
```

Weekly or monthly:
- Analyzes patterns across all braindumps
- Builds frameworks from scattered insights
- Updates "single source of truth" knowledge base
- Tracks evolution of thinking over time

## Why COG Works

### What Works
- ‚úÖ **Setup is trivial**: Drop files in, done. No complex configuration.
- ‚úÖ **Maintenance-free**: Self-heals and auto-organizes
- ‚úÖ **Actually portable**: Works on iPhone, iPad, Mac via iCloud
- ‚úÖ **Custom agents >> generic AI**: Specialized beats ChatGPT for repeated tasks
- ‚úÖ **Git for thoughts**: Version control shows thinking evolution

### What Doesn't Work
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires discipline‚Äîsystem only works if used consistently
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not for everyone‚Äîif you don't think in text files, this won't click
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Claude Code (though adaptable to other AI environments)

### Unexpected Benefits
- üí° **Thinking partner, not just storage**: Writing brain dumps knowing they'll be analyzed improves clarity
- üìä **Pattern recognition**: Discover insights you'd miss manually
- üîó **Cross-domain insights**: Personal wellness affects professional productivity (tracked quantitatively)
- üìÖ **Time patterns**: Git history reveals when you think best

## Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Commands

Edit `.claude/commands/*.md` to customize workflows:
```markdown
# Custom Command Example
/my-workflow

Your custom prompt here...
```

### Adding New Agents

Create `.claude/subagents/my-agent.md`:
```markdown
# My Custom Agent

## Purpose
[What this agent does]

## Process
[How it works]
```

### Template Customization

Modify `06-templates/*.md` to match your workflow:
```yaml
---
type: "custom-type"
domain: "personal|professional|project"
# Add your metadata fields
---
```

## Syncing Across Devices

### iCloud Sync (Recommended)
- Store vault in `iCloud Drive/Obsidian/`
- Automatically syncs to all Apple devices
- Obsidian mobile works perfectly

### Git Sync
```bash
# Daily workflow
git add .
git commit -m "Update knowledge base"
git push
```

Combine both: iCloud for instant sync, Git for version history.

## FAQ

**Q: Why not just use Notion/Roam/Obsidian alone?**
A: COG adds self-evolving intelligence. It doesn't just store‚Äîit learns, analyzes, and synthesizes insights automatically.

**Q: Do I need Claude Code specifically?**
A: Claude Code is recommended, but you can adapt the commands for any AI environment (VSCode + Claude extension, custom API integration, etc.)

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: COG is free (MIT license). You only pay for Claude Code usage (Anthropic's pricing).

**Q: Is my data private?**
A: Yes. Everything is local markdown files. COG uses Claude's API only when you invoke commands. No data stored on external servers.

**Q: Can I use this for team collaboration?**
A: Currently designed for personal use. Team features planned for future releases.

**Q: What if I don't use Git?**
A: Git is optional but recommended for version history. COG works fine without it using just iCloud sync.
