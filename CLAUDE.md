# COG Second Brain — Framework Instructions

## Integration Preferences

Before using any external integration in a skill, check `00-inbox/MY-INTEGRATIONS.md`:

- **Active integrations**: Use normally.
- **Disabled integrations**: Skip silently. Do not attempt to call their tools, do not suggest setting them up, do not mention them in output.
- **Unknown integrations** (not listed in either section): Ask the user if they want to set it up. If they say no, add it to the Disabled section.

## Role Packs

COG uses role packs (`.claude/roles/*.md`) to personalize skill recommendations and integration suggestions per user role.

### How role matching works
1. During onboarding, the user's role text is matched against `role_id` and `aliases` in each role pack's YAML frontmatter.
2. The matched role pack is stored as `role_pack` in `00-inbox/MY-PROFILE.md` frontmatter.
3. When suggesting skills or workflows, check the user's `role_pack` and order recommendations by role relevance.

### Role-aware behavior
- **Skill suggestions**: When a user asks "what can COG do?" or similar, prioritize skills listed in their role pack. Show role-specific explanations from the pack.
- **Integration prompts**: When a skill needs an integration the user hasn't set up, check their role pack to provide role-specific context for why it matters.
- **No role pack match**: If the user's role doesn't match any pack, recommend core skills (`roles: [all]`) and let them discover team skills organically.

### Available role packs
Role packs live in `.claude/roles/`. New roles can be added by dropping a file following the `_template.md` format.
