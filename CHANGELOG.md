# Changelog

All notable changes to COG (Cognition + Obsidian + Git) will be documented in this file.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-02-09

### Upstream Update System

Users who fork or clone COG can now safely pull framework updates (skills, docs, scripts) without risking merge conflicts with their personal content.

### Added

#### Update Tooling
- **`cog-update.sh`** — Interactive bash script for updating framework files
  - `--check`: See available updates without making changes
  - `--dry-run`: Preview what would change
  - `--force`: Update all framework files at once
  - Interactive mode: Per-file prompts with diff, backup, and skip options
- **`/update-cog` skill** — Available in all 4 agent formats:
  - `.claude/skills/update-cog/SKILL.md` (Claude Code)
  - `.kiro/powers/cog-update/POWER.md` (Kiro)
  - `.gemini/commands/update-cog.toml` + `.gemini/skills/update-cog.md` (Gemini CLI)
  - `AGENTS.md` updated with `/update-cog` command (OpenAI Codex, others)
- **`COG-VERSION`** — Single-line version tracking file (currently `3.2.0`)

#### Content/Framework Separation
- **`.gitkeep` files** in all 15 content directories — preserves directory structure in upstream while `.gitignore` excludes user content
- **`.gitignore` rewrite** — Content folder ignores now active by default with `.gitkeep` whitelisting

#### Directory Structure Preservation
- `.gitkeep` added to: `00-inbox/`, `01-daily/`, `01-daily/briefs/`, `01-daily/checkins/`, `02-personal/`, `02-personal/braindumps/`, `03-professional/`, `03-professional/braindumps/`, `04-projects/`, `05-knowledge/`, `05-knowledge/consolidated/`, `05-knowledge/patterns/`, `05-knowledge/timeline/`, `05-knowledge/booklets/`, `06-templates/`

### Changed

#### Documentation
- **`README.md`** — Added "Keeping COG Updated" section, FAQ entries for updates, updated roadmap
- **`SETUP.md`** — Added comprehensive "Keeping COG Updated" section with all 3 update methods
- **`AGENTS.md`** — Added `/update-cog` command, version & updates configuration section
- **`GEMINI.md`** — Added `/update-cog` to available skills list
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — Added version bump protocol to "Before You Start" section
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — This entry

#### Integration
- **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** — Added update-cog skill, bumped version to 3.2.0
- **`marketplace-entry.json`** — Bumped version to 3.2.0
- **`.claude/skills/onboarding/SKILL.md`** — Added "Keeping COG Updated" to welcome guide template
- **`.kiro/powers/cog-onboarding/POWER.md`** — Added update mention to wrap-up section

### Removed
- **`example-vault/`** — Removed empty directory (contained only `.DS_Store`), replaced by `.gitkeep` files

### Design Decisions
- **Remote name `cog-upstream`**: Works for both fork and clone users without conflicting with `origin`
- **`git checkout <remote>/<branch> -- <file>`**: Surgical file replacement with zero conflict risk
- **Self-updating script**: `cog-update.sh` is in the framework file list, so it updates itself
- **Active .gitignore**: Content folder ignores are on by default so new users get safe defaults

## [3.1.0] - 2026-02-03

### Obsidian Tasks Plugin Integration

Tasks generated by COG skills now use the Obsidian Tasks emoji format, making them queryable in Tasks dashboards, daily notes, and date-based filters.

### Added

#### Obsidian Tasks Emoji Format
- All task items now include `📅 YYYY-MM-DD` due dates calculated from context
- **braindump**: "Immediate (24-48 hours)" → tomorrow's date, "Short-term (1-2 weeks)" → +1 week
- **daily-brief**: "Immediate Actions (Today/This Week)" → today or end of week
- **url-dump**: Practical takeaways → +1 week, Evaluation tasks → progressive dates (3 days to 2 weeks)

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-17

### Major Architecture Overhaul

This release represents a complete restructuring of COG to follow proven subagent architecture patterns, emphasizing separation of concerns and configuration-as-knowledge principles.

### Added

#### Onboarding System
- **New `/onboarding` command** - First-run setup that personalizes COG in ~2 minutes
  - Asks 6 essential questions: name, role, interests, news sources, projects, competitive watchlist
  - Creates readable markdown profile files in vault
  - No JSON configuration files - everything is human-readable markdown

#### Configuration as Knowledge
- **`00-inbox/MY-PROFILE.md`** - User's basic info, role, and active projects
- **`00-inbox/MY-INTERESTS.md`** - Topics of interest and preferred news sources
- **`03-professional/COMPETITIVE-WATCHLIST.md`** - Companies/people to track
- **`04-projects/[project]/PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md`** - Per-project overview documents
- **`00-inbox/WELCOME-TO-COG.md`** - Personalized welcome guide (auto-generated)

All configuration is now part of the knowledge base - searchable, linkable, and editable like any other note.

#### Subagent Architecture
- **`.claude/subagents/brain-dump-analyst.md`** - Specialized subagent for braindump analysis
  - Stream-of-consciousness processing
  - Domain classification
  - Theme extraction
  - Competitive intelligence detection
  - Structured output generation

- **`.claude/subagents/news-curator.md`** - Specialized subagent for news curation
  - Verified news research (7-day freshness requirement)
  - Multi-source cross-referencing
  - Strategic relevance analysis
  - Personalized briefing generation

### Changed

#### Command Architecture
Commands are now **thin orchestration layers** that delegate to specialized subagents:

**`/braindump` - Redesigned**
- Collects user's stream-of-consciousness input
- Asks for domain classification
- **Delegates ALL processing to brain-dump-analyst subagent**
- Confirms completion and shows summary
- No longer handles analysis directly

**`/daily-brief` - Redesigned**
- Reads user profile files (MY-PROFILE.md, MY-INTERESTS.md)
- **Delegates ALL news curation to news-curator subagent**
- Confirms completion and shows executive summary
- No longer searches or curates news directly

**`/weekly-checkin` - Simplified**
- Guided conversational reflection
- Direct document generation based on user responses
- Pattern identification through conversation
- No template dependency

#### Configuration Philosophy
- **Before**: Hidden JSON config files (`.claude/config/user-config.json`)
- **After**: Markdown notes in vault that are part of knowledge base
- Benefits:
  - Human-readable and directly editable
  - Searchable in Obsidian
  - Linkable from other notes
  - Version controlled with Git
  - Can include personal notes and context

### Removed

- **Deleted `templates/` directory entirely**
  - `templates/braindump-template.md`
  - `templates/daily-brief-template.md`
  - `templates/weekly-checkin-template.md`

- **Removed JSON configuration system**
  - `.claude/config/` directory and all JSON files

- **Eliminated template dependencies**
  - All content now dynamically generated based on context
  - Templates were static; dynamic generation is more flexible

### Architecture Benefits

#### Separation of Concerns
- **Commands**: Simple orchestrators that handle user interaction and delegation
- **Subagents**: Complex processors with detailed analysis frameworks and verification protocols
- Clear responsibility boundaries make system easier to understand and extend

#### Maintainability
- Commands are now < 200 lines (vs 250+ before)
- Complex logic isolated in specialized subagents
- Changes to analysis logic don't affect command structure
- Easy to add new subagents without modifying commands

#### Transparency
- All configuration visible and editable as markdown notes
- No hidden JSON files to debug
- User can see exactly what COG knows about them
- Configuration becomes part of their thinking/knowledge

#### Extensibility
- New subagents can be added by creating new `.md` files in `.claude/subagents/`
- Commands can delegate to multiple subagents as needed
- Subagents can collaborate by reading each other's outputs

### Documentation

- **README.md** - Updated to reflect:
  - Subagent architecture explanation
  - Simplified installation (no templates to copy)
  - 2-minute onboarding flow
  - Configuration-as-knowledge philosophy

- **New CHANGELOG.md** - This file, documenting all changes

### Migration Guide

If upgrading from v1.x:

1. **Remove old configuration**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .claude/config/
   ```

2. **Remove templates**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf templates/
   ```

3. **Pull new structure**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

4. **Run onboarding**:
   ```
   /onboarding
   ```
   This will create your new markdown-based profile.

5. **Your existing notes are safe** - Only `.claude/` structure changed, all your braindumps, briefs, and check-ins remain unchanged.

### Technical Details

#### File Changes
- Modified: `.claude/commands/braindump.md`
- Modified: `.claude/commands/daily-brief.md`
- Modified: `.claude/commands/weekly-checkin.md`
- Modified: `README.md`
- Added: `.claude/commands/onboarding.md`
- Added: `.claude/subagents/brain-dump-analyst.md`
- Added: `.claude/subagents/news-curator.md`
- Deleted: `templates/` (entire directory)
- Deleted: `.claude/config/` (entire directory)

#### Breaking Changes
- **Configuration format changed** - Old JSON configs no longer used
- **Template system removed** - Commands that relied on templates now generate content dynamically
- **Subagent delegation required** - Commands expect subagents to exist in `.claude/subagents/`

#### Backward Compatibility
- **Existing markdown files unchanged** - All your notes, briefs, braindumps remain compatible
- **Command names unchanged** - `/braindump`, `/daily-brief`, etc. work the same from user perspective
- **Directory structure unchanged** - `00-inbox/`, `01-daily/`, etc. remain the same

### Philosophy

This release embraces two key principles:

1. **Configuration is Knowledge** - Your preferences, interests, and setup are part of your second brain, not hidden config files.

2. **Commands Orchestrate, Subagents Process** - Commands handle user interaction and context gathering; specialized subagents handle complex analysis, verification, and generation.

These principles make COG more transparent, maintainable, and aligned with the "second brain" philosophy of making all knowledge visible and editable.
